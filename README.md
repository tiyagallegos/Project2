## Stretch Goals/Future Goals:
* Age calculator linked to birthdate widget to autopopulate age in years:months
* Working timer on feeding session page which autopopulates time when session completed
* No whitespaced, cleaned up code graveyard, better organzation, naming conventions, and RESTful routing
* Use of more materialize styling options and some tool tips
* Allow user to edit setup up page adding/deleting options for indvidualized feeding setups
* Linking of the data entities
* Access to progress notes printed on show page from patient profile
* Different user login options to link therapists to patients/caregivers and allow for editing and communication within the application
* Kid-friendly tracking option with pictures to allow patients to partipate in charting by selecting foods they are eating, etc.
